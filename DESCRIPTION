Description: Circular layout is an efficient way for the visualization of hug
    amounts of information. Here this package provides an implementatio
    of circular layout generation in R as well as an enhancement of availabl
    software. The flexibility of the package is based on the usage of low-leve
    graphics functions such that self-defined high-level graphics can be easil
    implemented by users for specific purposes. Together with the seamles
    connection between the powerful computational and visual environment in R
    it gives users more convenience and freedom to design figures fo
    better understanding complex patterns behind multiple dimensional data
    The package is described in Gu et al. 2014 <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btu393
